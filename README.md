# Define Custom Domain for your API Gateway 

Custom domain names are simpler and more intuitive URLs that you can provide to your API users. Also, you will have a consistent URL even if API Gateway is created. 

After deploying your API, you can invoke the API using the default base URL of the following format:

```sh
 [Without custom domain]
 https://api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/YourStage/Route
 
 [With custom domain]
 https://YourDomain/Route
 
```
