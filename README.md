# Define Custom Domain for your API Gateway 

Custom domain names are simpler and more intuitive URLs that you can provide to your API users.

After deploying your API, you (and your customers) can invoke the API using the default base URL of the following format:

```sh
 [Without custom domain]
 https://api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/YourStage/Route
 
 [With custom domain]
 https://YourDomain/Route
 
```
